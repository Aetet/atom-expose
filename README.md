# Atom Tabs Exposé

Quick tab overview of open files. Similar to Mac OSX Exposé / Mission Control, Firefox Tab Group, Safari and Chrome Tab Overview, etc.

Toggle expose with <kbd>cmd-shift-e</kbd> on Mac OSX and <kbd>alt-shift-e</kbd> on Linux and Windows.

* The overview layout tries to simulate your current themes tab styling.
* The text editor preview is taken from [Minimap](https://github.com/atom-minimap/minimap) if present, else a suitable file icon is used.
* Shows file icons in tabs if the [file-icon package](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons) is installed.
