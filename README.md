# Atom Tabs Exposé

Quick tab overview of open files. Similar to Mac OSX Exposé / Mission Control, Firefox Tab Group, Safari and Chrome Tab Overview, etc.

The overview layout tries to simulate your current themes tab styling.
The text editor preview is taken from [Minimap](https://github.com/atom-minimap/minimap) if present, else a suitable file icon is used.
Shows file icons in tabs if the [file-icon package](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons) is installed.
